I downloaded some files from http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2018.php and wrote a script to create a frequency lists of words (the list in unformatted, i.e., don't -> don + t, c'est = c + est, etc). I did the same thing with all the sentences in the same languages owned by native speakers in the Tatoeba corpus. After comparing the two frequency lists, I compiled a file that gives you an idea of how the frequency of the words in Tatoeba compares to that of the OpenSubtitles corpus.

If you're looking for words to write example sentences for Tatoeba, then you should look at the arrows '<-- increase'. They indicate the words that should appear more (proportionally) in the Tatoeba Corpus.
